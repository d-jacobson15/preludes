        <p>I<br>The winter evening settles down<br>With smell of steaks in passageways.<br>Six o’clock.<br>The burnt-out ends of smoky days.<br>And now a gusty shower wraps<br>The grimy scraps<br>Of withered leaves about your feet<br>And newspapers from vacant lots;<br>The showers beat<br>On broken blinds and chimney-pots,<br>And at the corner of the street<br>A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps.<br><br>And then the lighting of the lamps.</p>

        <p>II<br>The morning comes to consciousness<br>Of faint stale smells of beer<br>From the sawdust-trampled street<br>With all its muddy feet that press<br>To early coffee-stands.<br>With the other masquerades<br>That time resumes,<br>One thinks of all the hands<br>That are raising dingy shades<br>In a thousand furnished rooms.</p>

        <p>III<br>You tossed a blanket from the bed,<br>You lay upon your back, and waited;<br>You dozed, and watched the night revealing<br>The thousand sordid images<br>Of which your soul was constituted;<br>They flickered against the ceiling.<br>And when all the world came back<br>And the light crept up between the shutters<br>And you heard the sparrows in the gutters,<br>You had such a vision of the street<br>As the street hardly understands;<br>Sitting along the bed’s edge, where<br>You curled the papers from your hair,<br>Or clasped the yellow soles of feet<br>In the palms of both soiled hands.</p>

        <p>IV<br>His soul stretched tight across the skies<br>That fade behind a city block,<br>Or trampled by insistent feet<br>At four and five and six o’clock;<br>And short square fingers stuffing pipes,<br>And evening newspapers, and eyes<br>Assured of certain certainties,<br>The conscience of a blackened street<br>Impatient to assume the world.<br><br>I am moved by fancies that are curled<br>Around these images, and cling:<br>The notion of some infinitely gentle<br>Infinitely suffering thing.<br><br>Wipe your hand across your mouth, and laugh;<br>The worlds revolve like ancient women<br>Gathering fuel in vacant lots.</p>
